Youtube demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlqW3zGNsto

## Who is this for

- You are a web3 web app that wishes to integrate messaging functionality
- Replace current user-to-user or user-to-app messaging workflow which happens inside discord / telegram
- Provide a much better UX that links directly to the user's wallet, which they are already using to interact with your dapp
- Provide a much more secure experience than having to share one's wallet id inside discord or clicking external links
- Enable users to communicate without leaving your web app (increasing engagement & time spent within the app)
- Differentiate yourself from competition still stuck in the web 2.5 world

## Roadmap

- Support token-gated group messaging (available in our web app)
- Enhanced spam filtering, conditional messaging permissions
- User-to-dapp support helpdesk, dapp-to-user announcements
- User analytics dashboard
- Optional message notifications inside email / telegram
- ...and much more

Talk to us to discuss the details of this and your requirements!
