# WalletChat EthGlobal2022 Submission

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  From here, we modified the site a bit, to add some navigation tabs; however we mainly focused on integration of a wallet-to-wallet chat widget, based on some open source APIs and repositories.  

## What we worked on for this hackathon

### Vercel Project Testing Website
https://eth-global2022.vercel.app - we build this site 100% during the hackathon.

### WalletChat Widget with Collapsible Button
For this hackathon we created and integrated a Chat Widget.  The basis of the logic of chat functionality for the widget is open source at: https://github.com/cryptoKevinL/walletchat/, which is 100% open source.

### NPM package for the Wallet-to-Wallet Integration
https://github.com/hjunleon/react-wallet-chat/tree/master - this was built 100% during the hackathon.
